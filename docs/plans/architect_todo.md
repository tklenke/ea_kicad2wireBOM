## CURRENT STATUS

✅ **Phase 1-13 Complete** - Production-ready wire BOM generation tool
✅ **306/306 tests passing**

**Design Documents**:
- `kicad2wireBOM_design.md` v3.6 - Main design specification

- N-way multipoint connections with power symbol support
- Comprehensive validation framework (strict and permissive modes)
- 3D SVG routing diagrams with optional 2D mode
- System routing diagrams (one per system code)
- Component wiring diagrams (first-hop connections per component)
- Component star diagrams (radial/polar logical connectivity view)
- Landscape orientation with centered origin, aircraft-pointing-up
- Reversed non-linear BL scaling (expanded centerline, compressed wingtips)
- Circuit labels grouped under components
- Unified output directory with multiple formats
- Component BOM, engineering report, HTML index
