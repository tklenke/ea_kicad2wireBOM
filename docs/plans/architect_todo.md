# Architect TODO: kicad2wireBOM

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Phase 1-6 Complete - Major Milestone Achieved ✅

---

## CURRENT STATUS

✅ **All Planned Features Complete**: 150/150 tests passing
- Schematic parsing, connectivity graph, junction handling all working
- 3+way multipoint connection logic implemented and tested
- Unified BOM generation created and integrated into CLI
- Validation & error handling with notes aggregation complete
- CSV output correctly includes multipoint entries and notes field
- CLI supports both strict and permissive modes

**Primary Design Doc**: `docs/plans/kicad2wireBOM_design.md` v2.6
**Validation Design**: `docs/plans/validation_design.md`

## KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS (All Implemented)

All major architectural decisions have been implemented and validated:

1. **3+Way Connections** (Section 4.4): Multi-point connections using (N-1) labeling convention
2. **Unified BOM Generation** (Section 4.5): Single `bom_generator.py` module handles all connection types
3. **Pin Position Calculation** (Section 4.1): Precise calculation with rotation matrices and mirroring
4. **Junction Handling** (Sections 3.5, 4.2, 4.3): Graph-based approach with explicit junction elements
5. **Wire Endpoint Tracing** (Section 4.3): Recursive tracing through wire_endpoint nodes
6. **Notes Aggregation** (Section 4.5): BFS traversal collects notes from all wire fragments in a circuit
7. **Validation Framework**: Missing labels, duplicate labels, non-circuit label handling

## OPEN QUESTIONS

**Hierarchical Schematics**: Are your aircraft schematics flat or hierarchical?
- Flat: Current design handles this ✅
- Hierarchical: Would need sheet interconnection design (future work)

---

## NEXT PHASE OPTIONS

The tool is now production-ready for basic wire BOM generation. Future enhancements could include:

1. **CLI Enhancements**: Markdown output, engineering mode, verbose/quiet flags
2. **Wire Calculations**: Actual length/gauge/voltage drop (currently using defaults)
3. **Production Features**: REVnnn filenames, --schematic-requirements output
4. **Hierarchical Schematics**: Multi-sheet support (if needed by Tom)
5. **Advanced Features**: See `docs/notes/opportunities_for_improvement.md`

**Status**: Awaiting Tom's direction on next priorities

## NOTES

- All core functionality is complete and tested
- System is ready for real-world usage
- No outstanding architectural tasks
- Future work should be driven by actual usage requirements
