# Architect TODO: kicad2wireBOM

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Phase 5B - Unified BOM Generation Refactoring Ready for Programmer

---

## CURRENT STATUS

âœ… **Phases 1-5 Complete**: 122/122 tests passing
- Schematic parsing, connectivity graph, junction handling all working
- 3+way multipoint connection logic implemented and tested

ðŸ”§ **Current Issue**: CLI doesn't use multipoint logic - CSV output incorrect
- Integration tests pass but CLI produces wrong output
- Need unified BOM generation to fix gap between tests and production

**Next Step**: Programmer implements Task 8 (unified BOM generation refactoring)

## ACTIVE ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### 3+Way Connections âœ…

**Decision**: Implement multi-point connections (N â‰¥ 3 pins) using (N-1) labeling convention

**Labeling Convention**:
- N pins â†’ expect (N-1) circuit ID labels
- Unlabeled segments form backbone
- Pin NOT reached by labeled segment = common endpoint
- Each labeled wire: labeled-pin â†’ common-pin

**Common Pin Algorithm**: Use SEGMENT-level analysis
- Trace segments from each pin through connections (transparent) to junctions (stop points)
- Pin whose segment has NO labels = common pin

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.4

### Unified BOM Generation âœ…

**Decision**: Create `bom_generator.py` module with `generate_bom_entries()` function

**Problem**: Multipoint logic passes tests but CLI doesn't use it (code duplication gap)

**Solution**:
- Single function handles both multipoint and regular 2-point connections
- CLI and tests use identical code path
- Eliminates duplication, ensures correctness

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.5, programmer_todo.md Task 8

## OPEN QUESTIONS

**Hierarchical Schematics**: Are your aircraft schematics flat or hierarchical?
- Flat: Current design handles this
- Hierarchical: Need sheet interconnection design (future work)
