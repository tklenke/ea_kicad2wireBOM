# Architect TODO: kicad2wireBOM

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Phase 1-5 Complete - Core Features Implemented ✅

---

## CURRENT STATUS

✅ **All Core Features Complete**: 125/125 tests passing
- Schematic parsing, connectivity graph, junction handling all working
- 3+way multipoint connection logic implemented and tested
- Unified BOM generation created and integrated into CLI
- CSV output correctly includes multipoint entries

**Next Step**: Awaiting direction from Tom on next phase (validation, enhancements, or new features)

## KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS (Implemented)

All major architectural decisions have been implemented and validated:

1. **3+Way Connections** (Section 4.4): Multi-point connections using (N-1) labeling convention
2. **Unified BOM Generation** (Section 4.5): Single `bom_generator.py` module handles all connection types
3. **Pin Position Calculation** (Section 4.1): Precise calculation with rotation matrices and mirroring
4. **Junction Handling** (Sections 3.5, 4.2, 4.3): Graph-based approach with explicit junction elements
5. **Wire Endpoint Tracing** (Section 4.3): Recursive tracing through wire_endpoint nodes

**Primary Design Doc**: `docs/plans/kicad2wireBOM_design.md` v2.6

## OPEN QUESTIONS

**Hierarchical Schematics**: Are your aircraft schematics flat or hierarchical?
- Flat: Current design handles this ✅
- Hierarchical: Would need sheet interconnection design (future work)

## POTENTIAL NEXT PHASES

**Phase 6 Options** (Awaiting Tom's direction):
1. **Validation & Error Handling**: Enhanced validation, better error messages
2. **CLI Enhancements**: Validation mode, verbose output, markdown format
3. **New Features**: See `docs/notes/opportunities_for_improvement.md` for ideas
4. **Hierarchical Schematic Support**: If Tom needs this
5. **Production Readiness**: Documentation, packaging, distribution
