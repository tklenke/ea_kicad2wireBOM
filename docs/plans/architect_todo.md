## KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS (All Implemented)

All major architectural decisions have been implemented and validated:

1. **LocLoad Custom Field** (Section 2.2): Dedicated custom field for component location and electrical data
2. **3+Way Connections** (Section 4.4): Multi-point connections using (N-1) labeling convention
3. **Unified BOM Generation** (Section 4.5): Single `bom_generator.py` module handles all connection types
4. **Pin Position Calculation** (Section 4.1): Precise calculation with rotation matrices and mirroring
5. **Junction Handling** (Sections 3.5, 4.2, 4.3): Graph-based approach with explicit junction elements
6. **Wire Endpoint Tracing** (Section 4.3): Recursive tracing through wire_endpoint nodes
7. **Notes Aggregation** (Section 4.5): BFS traversal collects notes from all wire fragments in a circuit
8. **Validation Framework**: Missing labels, duplicate labels, non-circuit label handling

## OPEN QUESTIONS

**Hierarchical Schematics**: Are your aircraft schematics flat or hierarchical?
- Flat: Current design handles this ✅
- Hierarchical: Would need sheet interconnection design (future work)

---


## PHASE 7: Hierarchical Schematic Support ✅ DESIGN COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ Design complete - Ready for Programmer implementation
**Design Location**: Section 8 of `kicad2wireBOM_design.md` v3.0
**Date Completed**: 2025-01-24

**Summary**:

Comprehensive design specification completed for hierarchical schematic support. Covers:

### Architecture Decisions

✅ **Unified Connectivity Graph** - Single graph spanning all sheets (not per-sheet graphs)
- Added node types: `sheet_pin`, `hierarchical_label`
- Cross-sheet edges explicit in graph
- Existing trace algorithms work unchanged

✅ **Recursive Parser** - Parse root sheet, then recursively parse sub-sheets
- HierarchicalSchematic container with root_sheet + sub_sheets dict
- SheetConnection dataclass maps pin/label pairs
- GlobalNet dataclass for power symbols (GND, +12V, etc.)

✅ **Circuit Label Resolution** - Follows electrical connectivity, not label names
- Circuit identity spans sheets
- Labels "L2A" (main) and "L2B" (lighting) part of same circuit
- Trace connectivity through graph to collect all labels

✅ **Component References** - Resolved from hierarchical instance paths
- Reference designators unique across all sheets
- Parser extracts correct reference from instance path

### Implementation Phases

Detailed 5-phase implementation plan created:
1. **Phase 7.1**: Parser enhancement (recursive sheet parsing)
2. **Phase 7.2**: Graph builder enhancement (unified graph)
3. **Phase 7.3**: Wire tracing update (cross-sheet tracing)
4. **Phase 7.4**: BOM generation update (multi-sheet circuits)
5. **Phase 7.5**: CLI update (hierarchical input)

### Test Strategy

Test fixture test_06 analyzed:
- Main sheet with battery, fuses, switches
- Lighting sub-sheet with lamps (L1, L2, L3)
- Avionics sub-sheet with LRU
- Expected circuits: L2A, L3A (multipoint), A9A, P1A, G7A, etc.

### Documentation Updates

- Section 8 (NEW): Complete hierarchical design (8.1-8.14)
- Section 3.1: Parser updates for recursive parsing
- Section 4: Enhanced connectivity graph
- Section 10: New hierarchical_schematic.py module
- Section 12.2: Updated with Phase 7 status

**Next Action**: Programmer to implement Phase 7.1-7.5 following design spec

## NEXT PHASE OPTIONS

The tool is now production-ready for basic wire BOM generation. Future enhancements could include:

1. **CLI Enhancements**: Markdown output, engineering mode, verbose/quiet flags
2. **Wire Calculations**: Actual length/gauge/voltage drop (currently using defaults)
3. **Production Features**: REVnnn filenames, --schematic-requirements output
4. **Advanced Features**: See `docs/notes/opportunities_for_improvement.md`

**Current Priority**: LocLoad migration (Phase 6.5), then Hierarchical Schematics (Phase 7)

## NOTES

- All core functionality is complete and tested
- System is ready for real-world usage
- No outstanding architectural tasks
- Future work should be driven by actual usage requirements
