## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### 1. Pin Position Calculation Strategy âœ…

**Decision**: Use **precise** calculation with rotation matrices and mirroring

**Rationale**: Real schematics have multi-pin components with rotation/mirroring. Precise calculation ensures correct pin matching using straightforward 2D geometry.

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.1

---

### 2. Junction Handling Algorithm âœ…

**Decision**: Use **graph-based approach** with explicit junction elements only

**Rationale**: KiCad uses explicit `(junction ...)` elements to indicate electrical connections. Wires can cross in 2D without connecting.

**Critical Rule**:
- **Junction present** at (x,y) â†’ wires ARE connected
- **Junction absent** at (x,y) â†’ wires crossing are NOT connected

**Reference**: Design doc Sections 3.5, 4.2, 4.3

---

### 3. BOM Output Format âœ…

**Decision**: Junctions are **transparent** in BOM output

**Rationale**: In experimental aircraft, schematic junctions represent electrical connection points but must become physical components (terminal blocks, connectors, splice blocks) in the build. Wire-to-wire splicing is not acceptable for reliability and maintainability.

**Output Format**:
```csv
Wire Label,From Component,From Pin,To Component,To Pin,...
P1A,J1,1,SW1,3,...
P2A,J1,1,SW2,3,...
P3A,SW1,3,SW2,3,...
```

Each wire shows component-to-component connections by tracing through junctions.

**Reference**: Design doc Sections 4.3, 7.3

---

### 4. Wire Endpoint Tracing âœ…

**Decision**: Extend `trace_to_component()` to handle `wire_endpoint` nodes using same recursive pattern as junctions

**Rationale**: Labeled wire segments often connect to unlabeled wire segments at wire_endpoint nodes. Current architecture is sound - we just need to add the missing case to the existing recursive graph traversal.

**Status**: âœ… Complete - Implemented and tested (2025-10-20)

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.3

---

### 5. 3+Way Connections âœ…

**Decision**: Implement detection and validation of multi-point connections (N â‰¥ 3 component pins) using labeling convention

**Labeling Convention**: For N pins connected through junctions:
- Expect exactly (N-1) circuit ID labels
- Unlabeled segments form backbone (junction-to-junction, junction-to-common-pin)
- The pin NOT reached by any labeled segment is the common endpoint
- Each labeled wire generates one BOM entry: labeled-pin â†’ common-pin

**Rationale**:
- Matches physical reality of aircraft wiring (multiple grounds to battery, multiple feeds from distribution point)
- Labeling convention is intuitive and unambiguous
- Unlabeled pin clearly identifies the common endpoint (terminal block, ground bus, etc.)
- Scales naturally to any N â‰¥ 3

**Examples**:
- 3-way (test_03A P4A/P4B): SW1-pin2, SW2-pin2 â†’ J1-pin2 (terminal block)
- 4-way (test_04 grounds): L1/L2/L3 â†’ BT1-pin2 (battery negative)

**Status**: Architecture complete (2025-10-21) - Ready for Programmer implementation

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.4, programmer_todo.md "NEXT IMPLEMENTATION"

### 6. Common Pin Identification Algorithm (3+Way Connections) âœ…

**Decision**: Use **SEGMENT-level analysis** to identify the common pin

**Key Terminology**:
- **Fragment**: A single KiCad wire element (what the parser sees as a "wire")
- **Connection**: A point where exactly 2 fragments meet
- **Junction**: A point where 3+ fragments meet (KiCad junction element)
- **Segment**: The chain of fragments between a pin and a junction (or between two pins)

**Algorithm Definition**: A pin is "reached by a labeled segment" if the SEGMENT (chain of fragments) from that pin to the junction contains at least one labeled fragment.

**Precise Algorithm**:

For each pin in the N-pin group:
1. **Trace the segment** from the pin toward the junction/backbone:
   - Start at pin position
   - Follow connected fragments through "connections" (2-fragment points)
   - Stop when reaching a "junction" (3+ fragment point) or another group pin
2. **Check for labels**: If ANY fragment in this segment has a circuit ID label â†’ pin IS reached by labeled segment
3. **Identify common pin**: The ONE pin whose segment has NO labels is the common pin

**Example (test_03A P4A/P4B)**:

6 fragments â†’ 3 connections + 1 junction â†’ 3 segments:
- **Segment 1**: SW1-pin2 â†’ Junction (fragments: 10, 9) - has label P4B âœ“
- **Segment 2**: SW2-pin2 â†’ Junction (fragment: 11) - has label P4A âœ“
- **Segment 3**: J1-pin2 â†’ Junction (fragments: 6, 2, 13) - NO labels âœ“

**Common pin: J1-pin2** (terminal block)

**Rationale**:
- Works at the correct conceptual level (segments, not fragments)
- Connections are transparent (we trace through them)
- Junctions are stopping points (segment boundaries)
- Labels on any fragment in the segment mark that pin's branch

**Implementation Notes**:
1. Build fragment adjacency at each position
2. Count fragments per position to identify connections (2) vs junctions (3+)
3. From each pin, trace through fragments:
   - Follow through connections (2-fragment points)
   - Stop at junctions (3+ fragment points) or other group pins
   - Track if any fragment in the path has a circuit_id label
4. Return the pin whose segment has no labels

**Status**: Architectural decision complete (2025-10-21) - Ready for Programmer implementation

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.4, programmer_todo.md Task 3

## OPEN QUESTIONS

### Hierarchical Schematics

**Question**: Are your aircraft schematics flat or hierarchical (multiple sheets)?

**Impact**:
- Flat: Current design handles this (no changes needed)
- Hierarchical: Need to design sheet interconnection handling (future Phase 5)

**Recommendation**: Current implementation assumes flat schematics. Add hierarchical support later if needed.
