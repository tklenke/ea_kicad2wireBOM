## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### 1. Pin Position Calculation Strategy âœ…

**Decision**: Use **precise** calculation with rotation matrices and mirroring

**Rationale**: Real schematics have multi-pin components with rotation/mirroring. Precise calculation ensures correct pin matching using straightforward 2D geometry.

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.1

---

### 2. Junction Handling Algorithm âœ…

**Decision**: Use **graph-based approach** with explicit junction elements only

**Rationale**: KiCad uses explicit `(junction ...)` elements to indicate electrical connections. Wires can cross in 2D without connecting.

**Critical Rule**:
- **Junction present** at (x,y) â†’ wires ARE connected
- **Junction absent** at (x,y) â†’ wires crossing are NOT connected

**Reference**: Design doc Sections 3.5, 4.2, 4.3

---

### 3. BOM Output Format âœ…

**Decision**: Junctions are **transparent** in BOM output

**Rationale**: In experimental aircraft, schematic junctions represent electrical connection points but must become physical components (terminal blocks, connectors, splice blocks) in the build. Wire-to-wire splicing is not acceptable for reliability and maintainability.

**Output Format**:
```csv
Wire Label,From Component,From Pin,To Component,To Pin,...
P1A,J1,1,SW1,3,...
P2A,J1,1,SW2,3,...
P3A,SW1,3,SW2,3,...
```

Each wire shows component-to-component connections by tracing through junctions.

**Reference**: Design doc Sections 4.3, 7.3

---

### 4. Wire Endpoint Tracing âœ…

**Decision**: Extend `trace_to_component()` to handle `wire_endpoint` nodes using same recursive pattern as junctions

**Rationale**: Labeled wire segments often connect to unlabeled wire segments at wire_endpoint nodes. Current architecture is sound - we just need to add the missing case to the existing recursive graph traversal.

**Status**: âœ… Complete - Implemented and tested (2025-10-20)

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.3

---

### 5. 3+Way Connections âœ…

**Decision**: Implement detection and validation of multi-point connections (N â‰¥ 3 component pins) using labeling convention

**Labeling Convention**: For N pins connected through junctions:
- Expect exactly (N-1) circuit ID labels
- Unlabeled segments form backbone (junction-to-junction, junction-to-common-pin)
- The pin NOT reached by any labeled segment is the common endpoint
- Each labeled wire generates one BOM entry: labeled-pin â†’ common-pin

**Rationale**:
- Matches physical reality of aircraft wiring (multiple grounds to battery, multiple feeds from distribution point)
- Labeling convention is intuitive and unambiguous
- Unlabeled pin clearly identifies the common endpoint (terminal block, ground bus, etc.)
- Scales naturally to any N â‰¥ 3

**Examples**:
- 3-way (test_03A P4A/P4B): SW1-pin2, SW2-pin2 â†’ J1-pin2 (terminal block)
- 4-way (test_04 grounds): L1/L2/L3 â†’ BT1-pin2 (battery negative)

**Status**: Architecture complete (2025-10-21) - Ready for Programmer implementation

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.4, programmer_todo.md "NEXT IMPLEMENTATION"

## OPEN QUESTIONS

### Hierarchical Schematics

**Question**: Are your aircraft schematics flat or hierarchical (multiple sheets)?

**Impact**:
- Flat: Current design handles this (no changes needed)
- Hierarchical: Need to design sheet interconnection handling (future Phase 5)

**Recommendation**: Current implementation assumes flat schematics. Add hierarchical support later if needed.
