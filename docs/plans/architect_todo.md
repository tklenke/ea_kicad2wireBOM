## CURRENT STATUS

✅ **Phase 1-10 Complete** - Production-ready wire BOM generation tool with routing diagrams
✅ **224/224 tests passing**

**Design Documents**:
- `kicad2wireBOM_design.md` v3.2 - Main design specification
- `wire_routing_diagrams_design.md` - Routing diagrams (Phase 10 complete)
- `ea_wire_marking_standard.md` - Wire marking standard (maintained)

**Core Capabilities**:
- Flat and hierarchical schematics
- Circuit-based wire gauge calculation
- N-way multipoint connections
- Comprehensive validation framework
- SVG routing diagrams (optimized for 8.5×11 portrait printing)

## FUTURE OPTIONS

See `docs/notes/opportunities_for_improvement.md` for detailed feature ideas.

**Potential Next Phases**:
- 3D wire routing visualization (add WL dimension to diagrams)
- Interactive HTML diagrams with zoom/pan
- Wire harness weight calculation for W&B
- Multiple netlist processing (entire KiCad project at once)
- Temperature derating for hot environments

**No active architecture work pending.** System is production-ready.
