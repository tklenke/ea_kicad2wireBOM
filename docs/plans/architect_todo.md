# Architect TODO: kicad2wireBOM

**Status**: All Planned Architecture Complete ✅
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

---

## CURRENT STATUS

✅ **188/188 tests passing** - All core features and Phase 8 improvements implemented

**Design Documents**:
- `docs/plans/kicad2wireBOM_design.md` v3.0 - Complete design specification
- `docs/ea_wire_marking_standard.md` - Wire marking standard (EAWMS)

**Implemented Features**:
- Flat and hierarchical schematic parsing (2-level: main + sub-sheets)
- Connectivity graph with cross-sheet wire tracing
- 2-point and N-way multipoint connections
- Validation framework with connectivity-aware duplicate detection
- BOM generation with enhanced error messages, sorting, and coordinate-based component ordering
- CLI with strict/permissive modes

**The tool is production-ready for real-world usage.**

## OPEN QUESTIONS

**Tom's Schematic Structure**:
- Flat (single sheet): ✅ Supported
- 2-level hierarchical (main + sub-sheets): ✅ Supported
- Multi-level nested (sub-sheets within sub-sheets): ⚠️ Not yet supported
- Sheet instances (same sub-sheet used multiple times): ⚠️ Not yet supported

---

## NEXT PHASE OPTIONS

Future architectural work could include (see `docs/notes/opportunities_for_improvement.md`):

1. **CLI Enhancements**: Markdown output, engineering mode, verbose/quiet flags, JSON output
2. **Wire Calculations**: Actual voltage drop, temperature derating, bundle derating, custom tables
3. **Production Features**: REVnnn versioning, --schematic-requirements output, BOM diff, config files
4. **Advanced Hierarchical**: Multi-level nesting, sheet instances, hierarchical path tracking
5. **Integration**: KiCad plugin, GUI interface, component database, 3D visualization

**No active architectural tasks - awaiting Tom's direction for next phase.**
