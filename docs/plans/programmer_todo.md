## ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS / TODO

### Phase 4: Wire Connectivity and Network Tracing

**Current Limitation**: The CLI currently uses a simplified heuristic (connects first 2 components for all labeled wires). This works for simple 2-component circuits but doesn't properly trace wire connectivity through the schematic.

**What Needs Implementation**:

#### Task 4.1: Junction Extraction and Parsing
- [ ] Extract junction elements from schematic
- [ ] Parse junction positions
- [ ] Create Junction dataclass
- [ ] Add tests for junction extraction

#### Task 4.2: Wire Network Tracing
- [ ] Build connectivity graph from wire segments
- [ ] Trace wire paths from component pins through junctions
- [ ] Identify wire start/end components
- [ ] Handle multi-segment wires (connected via junctions)
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests

**Why This Matters**: test_03_fixture demonstrates the problem - two switches feeding one connector through a junction. We need to correctly identify which components each labeled wire connects.

#### Task 4.3: Component Pin Position Calculation
- [ ] Extract component position and rotation from schematic
- [ ] Calculate pin positions (simple approach initially)
- [ ] Match wire endpoints to nearest component pins
- [ ] Add tests for pin matching

**Reference**: See `docs/plans/kicad2wireBOM_design.md` Section 4.3 for algorithm

### Phase 5: Enhanced Wire Calculations

Current wire calculator reused from previous work - already functional!

**Potential Enhancements** (optional, not blocking):
- [ ] Add validation warnings for wires without labels (permissive mode)
- [ ] Add validation for orphaned labels
- [ ] Add duplicate circuit ID detection
- [ ] Improve current determination algorithm

### Phase 6: Output Generation

**Current Status**: CSV output works for basic cases

**TODO**:
- [ ] Test CSV output with complex multi-wire circuits
- [ ] Implement Markdown output (optional)
- [ ] Add engineering mode output (optional, can defer)

### Phase 7: CLI Polish

**Current Status**: Basic CLI works, tested

**TODO**:
- [ ] Add better error messages
- [ ] Add validation mode (check schematic without generating BOM)
- [ ] Add verbose/debug output option
- [ ] Configuration file loading (optional, can defer)

### Phase 8: Integration Testing

**TODO**:
- [ ] Create integration test for test_01_fixture
- [ ] Create integration test for test_02_fixture
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Create integration test for test_03_fixture (junction test)
- [ ] Add edge case tests

## NEXT SESSION RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **Junction handling** - This is the key differentiator for schematic-based parsing
   - Start with test_03_fixture analysis
   - Understand junction positions and wire connectivity
   - Implement network tracing algorithm

2. **Wire-to-component matching** - Currently using simple heuristic
   - Extract component positions from schematic
   - Implement wire endpoint to component pin matching

### Medium Priority (Robustness)
3. **Validation and error handling**
   - Add warnings for unlabeled wires
   - Detect orphaned labels
   - Validate circuit ID uniqueness

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
4. **Additional output formats** - Markdown, engineering mode
5. **Configuration file support** - YAML/TOML config
6. **Hierarchical schematic support** - Defer to later

## MIGRATION NOTES

This implementation was completed using a **hybrid migration approach**:

**Kept from netlist-based work:**
- Component dataclass and all tests
- Wire calculator functions (length, gauge, voltage drop)
- Reference data tables
- Wire BOM data structures
- CSV output generation
- 50 existing tests

**Replaced with schematic-based:**
- Parser (now uses sexpdata, not kinparse)
- Removed Circuit abstraction (netlist-specific)
- Added WireSegment and Label models
- Added label-to-wire proximity matching
- Updated CLI orchestration

**Result**: 80% code reuse, 20% new schematic-specific code. All 69 tests passing.

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### TDD Cycle (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
1. **RED**: Write failing test
2. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it fails correctly
3. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass test
4. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it passes
5. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green
6. **COMMIT**: Commit the change with updated todo

### Pre-Commit Checklist
Before EVERY commit:
1. Update this programmer_todo.md with completed tasks
2. Mark tasks `[x]` Complete when done
3. Run full test suite (`pytest -v`)
4. Include updated programmer_todo.md in commit

### Circle K Protocol
If you encounter:
- Design inconsistencies
- Architectural ambiguities
- Blockers requiring decisions

**THEN**:
1. Say "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"
2. Explain the issue clearly
3. Suggest options or ask for guidance
4. Wait for architectural decision

## ARCHIVED DOCUMENTS

**Moved to `docs/archive/`**:
- Old netlist-based design documents
- Previous implementation plans
- `programmer_notes.md` (archived after Phase 1-3 completion)

**DO NOT** reference archived documents - they describe the wrong architecture.
