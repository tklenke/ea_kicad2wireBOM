# Programmer TODO: kicad2wireBOM Implementation

**Project**: kicad2wireBOM - Wire BOM generator for experimental aircraft
**Status**: Task 8 Complete - All Core Features Implemented ✅
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22

---

## CURRENT STATUS

**Working** ✅:
- 125/125 tests passing (added 3 new unit tests for bom_generator)
- Schematic parsing, connectivity graph, multipoint detection all implemented
- Integration tests verify multipoint logic works correctly
- CLI now uses unified BOM generation - multipoint entries in CSV output!
- No code duplication - single source of truth for BOM generation

**Next Task**: Awaiting direction from Tom

## COMPLETED TASKS

### Task 8: Create unified bom_generator.py module ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-22)

**Problem**: Multipoint logic existed and passed tests, but CLI didn't use it.

**Solution**: Created `bom_generator.py` with `generate_bom_entries()` function that both CLI and tests use.

**Implementation Summary**:
- Created `kicad2wireBOM/bom_generator.py` with unified BOM generation function
- Added 3 unit tests in `tests/test_bom_generator.py`
- Refactored integration tests to eliminate ~80 lines of duplicated code
- Updated CLI to use unified function
- Verified CLI output includes multipoint entries (P4A, P4B, G1A, G2A, G3A)

**Results**:
- ✅ New `bom_generator.py` module created (92 lines)
- ✅ Unit tests for `generate_bom_entries()` pass (3 tests)
- ✅ Integration tests refactored and still pass
- ✅ CLI refactored to use new function (~50 lines removed)
- ✅ CLI CSV output now includes multipoint entries
- ✅ All 125 tests pass
- ✅ No code duplication between CLI and tests

**Verified Behavior**:
- test_03A: Generates 5 entries including P4A (SW2,2→J1,2) and P4B (SW1,2→J1,2)
- test_04: Generates 7 entries including G1A (L1,1→BT1,2), G2A (L2,1→BT1,2), G3A (L3,1→BT1,2)

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### TDD Cycle (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
1. **RED**: Write failing test
2. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it fails correctly
3. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass test
4. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it passes
5. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green
6. **COMMIT**: Commit with updated todo

### Pre-Commit Checklist
1. Update this programmer_todo.md with completed tasks
2. Run full test suite (`pytest -v`)
3. Include updated programmer_todo.md in commit

### Circle K Protocol
If you encounter design inconsistencies, architectural ambiguities, or blockers:
1. Say "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"
2. Explain the issue clearly
3. Suggest options or ask for guidance
4. Wait for architectural decision

## DESIGN REFERENCE

**Primary Design Doc**: `docs/plans/kicad2wireBOM_design.md` v2.6

**Key Sections**:
- Section 4.4: 3+way connections (multipoint)
- Section 4.5: Unified BOM generation **[CRITICAL FOR TASK 8]**
- Section 10.1: Module structure

---

## KEY FILES

### Implementation
- `kicad2wireBOM/parser.py` - Schematic parsing
- `kicad2wireBOM/schematic.py` - Data models
- `kicad2wireBOM/connectivity_graph.py` - Graph data structures and tracing
- `kicad2wireBOM/wire_connections.py` - Connection identification (2-point and multipoint)
- `kicad2wireBOM/bom_generator.py` - **[NEW - TO BE CREATED]** Unified BOM entry generation
- `kicad2wireBOM/__main__.py` - CLI entry point

### Test Fixtures
- `tests/fixtures/test_01_fixture.kicad_sch` - Simple 2-component circuit
- `tests/fixtures/test_03A_fixture.kicad_sch` - 3-way connection (P4A/P4B)
- `tests/fixtures/test_04_fixture.kicad_sch` - 4-way ground connection (G1A/G2A/G3A)
