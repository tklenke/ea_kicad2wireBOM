## âœ… RECENT BUG FIXES

### Y-Axis Inversion Bug in Pin Position Calculation - FIXED (2025-10-20)

**Discovered**: 2025-10-20 (Architect role investigation)
**Fixed**: 2025-10-20 (Programmer role - TDD approach)

**Severity**: CRITICAL - Affected all components with non-zero Y pin offsets

**Root Cause**: KiCad uses inverted Y-axis coordinate system (graphics convention where +Y is DOWN), but our pin position calculation was treating it as mathematical convention (+Y is UP).

**Bug Location**: `kicad2wireBOM/pin_calculator.py:62`

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before (WRONG):
abs_y = component.y + y_rot

# After (CORRECT):
abs_y = component.y - y_rot  # Y-axis inverted in KiCad (graphics convention: +Y is DOWN)
```

**Testing:**
- Added `test_calculate_pin_position_y_axis_inversion()` test verifying actual KiCad fixture data
- Updated 4 existing tests to reflect correct Y-axis coordinate system
- All 111 tests passing âœ…

**Verification:**
- SW1 pin 1 now correctly at (125.73, 73.66) âœ…
- J1 pin 2 now correctly at (148.59, 88.90) âœ…
- All rotation angles (90Â°, 180Â°, 270Â°) work correctly âœ…
- Y-mirroring works correctly with inverted coordinate system âœ…

## COMPLETED WORK

### âœ… Connector Component Tracing Bug FIXED (2025-10-20)

**Bug**: Connector components (like J1) were being skipped in favor of components reachable through longer wire paths.

**Root Cause**: `trace_to_component()` was iterating through wires and returning the FIRST component found. When a junction had multiple wires, it would find components through wire_endpoints before checking for direct component_pin connections.

**Solution**: Implemented two-pass tracing algorithm:
1. FIRST PASS: Check all connected wires for direct component_pin connections
2. SECOND PASS: If no direct connection, recurse through junctions/wire_endpoints

**Testing**:
- Added `test_trace_to_component_prioritizes_direct_component_pin()` test
- All 110 tests passing âœ…
- J1 connector now correctly recognized as endpoint

**Current Output** (`test_03A_fixture.kicad_sch`):
```csv
P2A: SW2-3 â†’ J1-1  âœ… (J1 recognized!)
P1A: J1-1 â†’ SW1-3  âœ… (J1 recognized!)
```

### âœ… Wire Endpoint Tracing Implementation (2025-10-20)

The `trace_to_component()` method now correctly handles all node types with proper prioritization:
- `component_pin` nodes â†’ returns component immediately âœ…
- `junction` nodes â†’ checks direct pins first, then traces recursively âœ…
- `wire_endpoint` nodes â†’ checks direct pins first, then traces recursively âœ…

## NEXT IMPLEMENTATION: 3+Way Connections

**Architectural Decision**: See kicad2wireBOM_design.md Section 4.4

**Requirement**: Implement detection and validation of 3+way connections (N â‰¥ 3 component pins connected through junctions).

**Key Concept**:
- N pins connected â†’ expect (N-1) labels
- Unlabeled pin is the common endpoint (terminal block, ground bus, etc.)
- Each labeled wire traces to the common unlabeled pin

**Implementation Tasks** (TDD approach):

### Task 1: Detect 3+Way Connections âœ… COMPLETE (2025-10-21)
- [x] Write test: `test_detect_3way_connection_with_3_pins()` using test_03A fixture (P4A/P4B case)
  - Fixture: `tests/fixtures/test_03A_fixture.kicad_sch`
  - Expected: Detect 3-pin group {SW1-pin2, SW2-pin2, J1-pin2}
- [x] Write test: `test_detect_4way_connection()` using test_04 fixture (G1A/G2A/G3A case)
  - Fixture: `tests/fixtures/test_04_fixture.kicad_sch`

### Task 3: Identify Common Pin
- [ ] Write test: `test_identify_common_pin_in_3way()`
  - test_03A P4A/P4B: expect J1-pin2 as common pin
  - test_04 grounds: expect BT1-pin2 as common pin
- [ ] Implement: Add method `identify_common_pin(group: set[ComponentPin], graph: ConnectivityGraph) -> ComponentPin`

  - The pin NOT reached by labeled segments is the common pin
  - Return common pin or None if ambiguous
- [ ] Run tests, verify common pin identification

### Task 4: Validate 3+Way Labeling

- [ ] Write test: `test_validate_3way_connection_too_few_labels()` - should error/warn
- [ ] Implement: Add validation in `wire_connections.py` or new `multipoint_validator.py`
  - Check: label_count == (N - 1)
  - Check: exactly one common pin identified
  - Strict mode: raise errors
  - Permissive mode: log warnings
- [ ] Run tests, verify validation

### Task 5: Generate BOM Entries for 3+Way Connections
- [ ] Write test: `test_generate_bom_for_3way_connection()`
  - test_03A: expect P4A: SW2-pin2 â†’ J1-pin2, P4B: SW1-pin2 â†’ J1-pin2
  - test_04: expect G1A: L1-pin1 â†’ BT1-pin2, etc.
- [ ] Modify: Update `identify_wire_connections()` or create new function for 3+way handling
  - For each labeled segment in 3+way group, generate entry: labeled-pin â†’ common-pin
- [ ] Run tests, verify BOM output matches expected

### Task 6: Integration Test with test_03A
- [ ] Write test: `test_03A_fixture_complete_bom_with_3way()`
  - Parse test_03A fixture
  - Generate complete BOM
  - Compare against `docs/input/test_03A_out_expected.csv`
  - All 5 wires should match expected output
- [ ] Fix any issues until test passes

### Task 7: Integration Test with test_04
- [ ] Create expected output file: `docs/input/test_04_out_expected.csv`
  - Document expected BOM for 4-way ground connection + power circuits
- [ ] Write test: `test_04_fixture_complete_bom_with_4way()`
  - Parse test_04 fixture
  - Generate complete BOM
  - Compare against expected output
- [ ] Fix any issues until test passes

**Success Criteria**:
- All existing tests still pass (111/111)
- New 3+way connection tests pass
- test_03A output matches expected (P4A/P4B correct)
- test_04 output correct for 4-way ground connection
