## üöß IN PROGRESS / TODO

### Phase 4: Pin Matching and Junction Handling

**Status**: ‚úÖ Architectural design complete (see kicad2wireBOM_design.md v2.1)

**Current Limitation**: The CLI uses a simplified heuristic (connects first 2 components for all wires). This works for test_01_fixture but fails for multi-pin components and junction-based networks.

**Architectural Decisions Made**:
- Pin calculation: **Precise** with rotation/mirroring (Section 4.1)
- Junction handling: **Graph-based** with explicit junctions only (Sections 3.5, 4.2)
- Implementation: 4 sub-phases (4A ‚Üí 4B ‚Üí 4C ‚Üí 4D)

---

#### Phase 4A: Pin Position Calculation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Calculate exact pin positions accounting for component rotation and mirroring

**Tasks**:
- [x] Parse symbol library definitions from schematic `(lib_symbols ...)` section
- [x] Extract pin definitions: position, number, angle, length
- [x] Create `PinDefinition` dataclass
- [x] Create `SymbolLibrary` class to cache pin definitions by lib_id
- [x] Implement pin position calculation algorithm:
  - [x] Apply mirror transform (if component.mirror_x or mirror_y)
  - [x] Apply 2D rotation matrix (component.rotation)
  - [x] Translate to component absolute position
- [x] Create `ComponentPin` dataclass with absolute position
- [x] Add tests for pin calculation:
  - [x] Component at 0¬∞ rotation
  - [x] Component at 90¬∞ rotation
  - [x] Component at 180¬∞ rotation
  - [x] Component at 270¬∞ rotation
  - [x] Component with X-axis mirror
  - [x] Component with Y-axis mirror
  - [x] Complex transform (mirror + rotation)

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.1

**Test Fixtures**:
- test_03A_fixture.kicad_sch (multi-pin switches with rotations)

**Implementation**:
- `kicad2wireBOM/symbol_library.py` - Symbol library parsing
- `kicad2wireBOM/pin_calculator.py` - Pin position calculation
- `tests/test_symbol_library.py` - 5 tests
- `tests/test_pin_calculator.py` - 7 tests
- Commit: 09ce5b3, 3f1f8c8

#### Phase 4B: Graph Data Structures ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Implement connectivity graph for network tracing

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create `NetworkNode` dataclass:
  - [x] Fields: position, node_type, component_ref, pin_number, junction_uuid
  - [x] Connected wire UUIDs set
- [x] Create `ConnectivityGraph` class:
  - [x] Nodes dictionary (keyed by rounded position)
  - [x] Wires dictionary (keyed by UUID)
  - [x] Junctions dictionary (keyed by UUID)
  - [x] Component pins dictionary (keyed by "REF-PIN")
- [x] Implement graph methods:
  - [x] `get_or_create_node(position, node_type)`
  - [x] `add_wire(wire)` - creates nodes at endpoints
  - [x] `add_junction(junction)` - marks node as junction type
  - [x] `add_component_pin(pin)` - marks node as component_pin type
  - [x] `get_connected_nodes(wire_uuid)` - returns start/end nodes
  - [x] `get_node_at_position(position, tolerance)` - finds nearby node
- [x] Add tests for graph operations:
  - [x] Node creation and retrieval
  - [x] Wire addition and endpoint matching
  - [x] Junction node creation
  - [x] Pin node creation
  - [x] Position matching with tolerance (0.01mm)
  - [x] Multiple wires at junction
  - [x] Wire connects to existing node

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.2

**Key Insight**: Round positions to 0.01mm precision for dictionary keys (handles float matching)

**Implementation**:
- `kicad2wireBOM/connectivity_graph.py` - NetworkNode and ConnectivityGraph classes
- `tests/test_connectivity_graph.py` - 12 tests
- Commit: 67baa4c

#### Phase 4C: Graph Building Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Build complete connectivity graph from schematic

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update Junction dataclass (add uuid, diameter, color)
- [x] Parse junction elements from schematic
- [x] Parse component lib_id, position, and rotation from schematic
- [x] Implement graph building workflow:
  1. [x] Parse symbol libraries and cache pin definitions
  2. [x] Calculate all component pin positions
  3. [x] Add all junctions to graph
  4. [x] Add all component pins to graph
  5. [x] Add all wires to graph (matches to existing nodes)
- [x] Add integration tests:
  - [x] test_01_fixture: Simple 2-component graph
  - [x] test_03A_fixture: Graph with junction + crossing wires
  - [x] Pins connect to wires correctly
  - [x] Junctions connect multiple wires

**Critical Rule**: Only connect wires through **explicit junction elements**
- Junction present at (x,y) ‚Üí wires ARE connected
- Junction absent at (x,y) ‚Üí wires crossing are NOT connected

**Reference**: Design doc Sections 3.5, 4.2

**Implementation**:
- `kicad2wireBOM/graph_builder.py` - build_connectivity_graph() function
- `tests/test_graph_building.py` - 5 integration tests
- Commit: 17e97b0, [next commit]

---

#### Phase 4D: Wire-to-Component Matching and BOM Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Use connectivity graph for accurate wire matching in BOM output

**Tasks**:
- [x] Implement `identify_wire_connections(wire, graph)`:
  - [x] Get start and end nodes from graph
  - [x] Convert node to reference string:
    - component_pin ‚Üí "SW1-1"
    - junction ‚Üí "JUNCTION-{uuid}"
    - wire_endpoint ‚Üí "UNKNOWN"
- [x] Update WireSegment dataclass:
  - [x] Add start_connection field
  - [x] Add end_connection field
- [x] Update CLI to use graph connections:
  - [x] Build connectivity graph after parsing
  - [x] Identify wire connections using graph
  - [x] Use connection info in BOM output
  - [x] Handle junction and unknown connections

**Reference**: Design doc Section 4.3

**Implementation**:
- `kicad2wireBOM/wire_connections.py` - identify_wire_connections() function
- Updated `kicad2wireBOM/__main__.py` - CLI uses graph for connections
- Updated `kicad2wireBOM/schematic.py` - WireSegment has connection fields
- `tests/test_wire_connections.py` - 5 tests
- Commit: [next commit]

**BOM Output Example** (test_01_fixture):
```
Wire Label | From    | To              | ...
P1A        | SW1-1   | JUNCTION-51609a | ...
P2A        | SW2-3   | JUNCTION-51609a | ...
(unlabeled)| JUNCTION-51609a | J1-1   | ...
```

## MIGRATION NOTES

This implementation was completed using a **hybrid migration approach**:

**Kept from netlist-based work:**
- Component dataclass and all tests
- Wire calculator functions (length, gauge, voltage drop)
- Reference data tables
- Wire BOM data structures
- CSV output generation
- 50 existing tests

**Replaced with schematic-based:**
- Parser (now uses sexpdata, not kinparse)
- Removed Circuit abstraction (netlist-specific)
- Added WireSegment and Label models
- Added label-to-wire proximity matching
- Updated CLI orchestration

**Result**: 80% code reuse, 20% new schematic-specific code. All 69 tests passing.

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### TDD Cycle (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
1. **RED**: Write failing test
2. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it fails correctly
3. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass test
4. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it passes
5. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green
6. **COMMIT**: Commit the change with updated todo

### Pre-Commit Checklist
Before EVERY commit:
1. Update this programmer_todo.md with completed tasks
2. Mark tasks `[x]` Complete when done

### Circle K Protocol
If you encounter:
- Design inconsistencies
- Architectural ambiguities
- Blockers requiring decisions

**THEN**:
1. Say "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"
2. Explain the issue clearly
3. Suggest options or ask for guidance
4. Wait for architectural decision
