# Programmer TODO: kicad2wireBOM Implementation

**Project**: kicad2wireBOM - Wire BOM generator for experimental aircraft
**Status**: Phase 1-6 Complete - Major Milestone Achieved ✅
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22

---

## CURRENT STATUS

✅ **All Planned Features Complete**: 150/150 tests passing

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ Schematic parsing (S-expressions, symbol libraries)
- ✅ Pin position calculation (rotation, mirroring, transforms)
- ✅ Connectivity graph building (wires, junctions, components)
- ✅ 2-point wire connections
- ✅ 3+way multipoint connections with (N-1) labeling
- ✅ Unified BOM generation
- ✅ Notes field infrastructure
- ✅ Notes aggregation across wire fragments
- ✅ Validator module (missing labels, duplicates, non-circuit labels)
- ✅ CLI with --permissive flag
- ✅ CSV output with all fields

**Status**: All implementation tasks complete. Ready for next phase or code review.

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### TDD Cycle (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
1. **RED**: Write failing test
2. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it fails correctly
3. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass test
4. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it passes
5. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green
6. **COMMIT**: Commit with updated todo

### Pre-Commit Checklist
1. Update this programmer_todo.md with completed tasks
2. Run full test suite (`pytest -v`)
3. Include updated programmer_todo.md in commit

### Circle K Protocol
If you encounter design inconsistencies, architectural ambiguities, or blockers:
1. Say "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"
2. Explain the issue clearly
3. Suggest options or ask for guidance
4. Wait for architectural decision

## NEXT STEPS

**Status**: Awaiting Tom's direction on next priorities

No outstanding implementation tasks. Future work depends on:
- Real-world usage feedback
- New feature requests
- Performance optimization needs
- Additional validation requirements

See `docs/notes/opportunities_for_improvement.md` for potential future enhancements.
