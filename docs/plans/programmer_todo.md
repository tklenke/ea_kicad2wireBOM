# Programmer TODO: kicad2wireBOM Implementation

**Project**: kicad2wireBOM - Wire BOM generator for experimental aircraft
**Status**: Phase 6 Revision - Notes Aggregation Bug Fix üöß
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22

---

## CURRENT STATUS

‚úÖ **Phase 1-5 Complete** (Core features)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Phase 6 Needs Revision** (Validation & Error Handling):
- 146/146 tests passing but test_05C output is incorrect
- ‚úÖ Notes field infrastructure implemented
- ‚úÖ CSV output includes Notes column
- ‚úÖ Validator module with all validation checks implemented
- ‚úÖ Integration tests for test_05A/B/C fixtures all passing
- ‚úÖ CLI --permissive flag working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BUG FOUND**: Notes not aggregated across wire fragments (test_05C)

**Issue Identified by Architect**:
- test_05C fixture has "10AWG" label on vertical wire fragment (BT1-2 ‚Üí junction)
- Circuit ID "G4A" label is on horizontal wire fragment (junction ‚Üí GB1-1)
- Expected: G4A BOM entry should have notes="10AWG"
- Actual: G4A BOM entry has notes="" (empty)
- Root cause: Notes only collected from fragment with circuit ID, not all fragments forming circuit

**Status**: Architectural design revised. Ready for implementation.
**Next Task**: Implement notes aggregation across wire fragments in bom_generator.py

## PHASE 6 REVISION: NOTES AGGREGATION

**Architectural Decision**: Notes must be aggregated from ALL wire fragments forming a circuit, not just the fragment with the circuit ID label.

**Design References**:
- `docs/plans/validation_design.md` - Section 7: Integration Points (bom_generator.py)
- `docs/plans/kicad2wireBOM_design.md` - Section 3.4: Label Extraction and Association
- `docs/plans/kicad2wireBOM_design.md` - Section 4.5: Notes Aggregation Algorithm

### Task: Implement Notes Aggregation in bom_generator.py

**Objective**: Modify `bom_generator.py` to collect notes from all wire fragments forming a circuit.

**Current Behavior** (line 75 in bom_generator.py):
```python
notes_str = ' '.join(wire.notes) if wire.notes else ''
```
This only uses notes from the single wire fragment with the circuit_id.

**Required Behavior**:
- Traverse connectivity graph to find ALL wire fragments between from_conn and to_conn
- Collect notes from each fragment's notes list
- Deduplicate (avoid same note appearing multiple times)
- Concatenate with space separator

**Implementation Steps**:

1. [ ] **Write helper function**: `collect_circuit_notes(graph, circuit_id, from_conn, to_conn)`
   - Takes connectivity graph and endpoint connections
   - Uses BFS/DFS to traverse from from_pos to to_pos
   - Collects notes from all wire segments in path
   - Returns deduplicated, space-separated string

2. [ ] **Write unit tests** for `collect_circuit_notes()`:
   - Test case: Single fragment with notes
   - Test case: Multiple fragments, notes on one fragment
   - Test case: Multiple fragments, notes on multiple fragments
   - Test case: Duplicate notes (verify deduplication)
   - Test case: No notes (empty string)

3. [ ] **Update `generate_bom_entries()`** to use new helper:
   - Replace `' '.join(wire.notes)` with call to `collect_circuit_notes()`
   - Pass graph, circuit_id, from_conn, to_conn

4. [ ] **Verify test_05C output**:
   - Run CLI on test_05C_fixture.kicad_sch
   - Verify G4A entry has notes="10AWG"
   - Verify L2A entry has notes="24AWG"

5. [ ] **Run full test suite**: Ensure no regressions (146/146 tests should still pass)

6. [ ] **Update expected output file**: `docs/input/test_05C_out_expected.csv` if needed

7. [ ] **Commit with updated programmer_todo.md**

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### TDD Cycle (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
1. **RED**: Write failing test
2. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it fails correctly
3. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass test
4. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it passes
5. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green
6. **COMMIT**: Commit with updated todo

### Pre-Commit Checklist
1. Update this programmer_todo.md with completed tasks
2. Run full test suite (`pytest -v`)
3. Include updated programmer_todo.md in commit

### Circle K Protocol
If you encounter design inconsistencies, architectural ambiguities, or blockers:
1. Say "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"
2. Explain the issue clearly
3. Suggest options or ask for guidance
4. Wait for architectural decision
