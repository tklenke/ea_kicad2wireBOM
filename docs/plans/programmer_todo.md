# Programmer TODO: kicad2wireBOM Implementation

**Project**: kicad2wireBOM - Wire BOM generator for experimental aircraft
**Status**: Phase 1-5 Complete ✅
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22

---

## CURRENT STATUS

✅ **All Core Features Implemented**:
- 125/125 tests passing
- Schematic parsing, connectivity graph, multipoint detection working
- Unified BOM generation module (`bom_generator.py`) created
- CLI produces correct output including multipoint entries
- No code duplication between CLI and tests

**Next Task**: Awaiting direction from Tom

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### TDD Cycle (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
1. **RED**: Write failing test
2. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it fails correctly
3. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass test
4. **Verify**: Run test, confirm it passes
5. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green
6. **COMMIT**: Commit with updated todo

### Pre-Commit Checklist
1. Update this programmer_todo.md with completed tasks
2. Run full test suite (`pytest -v`)
3. Include updated programmer_todo.md in commit

### Circle K Protocol
If you encounter design inconsistencies, architectural ambiguities, or blockers:
1. Say "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"
2. Explain the issue clearly
3. Suggest options or ask for guidance
4. Wait for architectural decision

## KEY FILES

### Implementation Modules
- `kicad2wireBOM/parser.py` - S-expression parsing
- `kicad2wireBOM/schematic.py` - Data models
- `kicad2wireBOM/symbol_library.py` - Symbol library parsing
- `kicad2wireBOM/pin_calculator.py` - Pin position calculation
- `kicad2wireBOM/connectivity_graph.py` - Graph data structures
- `kicad2wireBOM/wire_connections.py` - Connection identification (multipoint)
- `kicad2wireBOM/bom_generator.py` - Unified BOM entry generation ✅
- `kicad2wireBOM/__main__.py` - CLI entry point

### Test Fixtures
- `tests/fixtures/test_01_fixture.kicad_sch` - Simple 2-component circuit
- `tests/fixtures/test_03A_fixture.kicad_sch` - 3-way connection (P4A/P4B)
- `tests/fixtures/test_04_fixture.kicad_sch` - 4-way ground connection (G1A/G2A/G3A)

## COMPLETED WORK ARCHIVE

<details>
<summary>Phases 1-5: Expand to see completed implementation history</summary>

### Phase 5: Unified BOM Generation ✅ (2025-10-22)
- Created `kicad2wireBOM/bom_generator.py` with `generate_bom_entries()` function
- Added 3 unit tests in `tests/test_bom_generator.py`
- Refactored integration tests (eliminated ~80 lines of duplicated code)
- Updated CLI to use unified function (~50 lines removed)
- Verified multipoint entries in CSV output (P4A, P4B, G1A, G2A, G3A)
- **Result**: 125/125 tests passing

### Phase 4: 3+Way Multipoint Connections ✅ (2025-10-21)
- Task 1-7: Detect, validate, and generate BOM entries for N≥3 pin connections
- Implemented (N-1) labeling convention
- Common pin identification using segment-level analysis
- Integration tests with test_03A and test_04
- **Result**: 122/122 tests passing

### Phase 3: Bug Fixes ✅ (2025-10-20)
- Y-Axis Inversion: Fixed pin position calculation for KiCad coordinate system
- Connector Component Tracing: Two-pass algorithm for direct connections
- Wire Endpoint Tracing: Extended trace_to_component() for wire_endpoint nodes

### Phases 1-2: Foundation ✅
- S-expression parser using sexpdata library
- Schematic data models (WireSegment, Component, Junction)
- Symbol library parsing and pin position calculation
- Connectivity graph building
- Basic 2-point wire connection identification

## POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK

See `docs/notes/opportunities_for_improvement.md` for enhancement ideas:
- Validation & error handling improvements
- CLI polish (validation mode, verbose output, markdown format)
- Optional features (engineering mode, hierarchical schematics)
- Wire specification overrides, configuration files
