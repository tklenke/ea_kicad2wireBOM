1. SCOPE
1.1 Scope. This standard establishes identification coding systems for all insulated hookup and lead wire used in
electrical and electronic equipment by the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. These coding systems
should also be used for identifying lead wires on Hall generators and ac and dc wire coding methods specified (see
4.9 and 4.10).
1.2 Classification. Identification of hookup wiring and lead wire shoud be limited to the following systems:
System I – Differentiation color coding for chassis wiring. This system should be employed in complex
electronic equipment having numerous wiring points (terminations) and requiring different colored wires for
identification. Functional coding (system II) would be inadequate for those complex equipments because of its
limited scope of significant colors.
System II – Functional color coding of chassis wiring. This system should be employed in simple electronic
equipments where it would be advantageous to identify a circuit function or a component part lead by its
significant colored wire.
System III – Differentiation or functional coding of chassis wiring by printed markings. This system should be
employed as an alternate for systems I and II and is preferred for maintaining or repairing equipments. White
wires are used for replacement, and will be marked with the designated color or symbol to readily identify it in
the equipment. Marking may be accomplished through the use of sleeving where the diameter of the wire is so
small as to make printing impracticable.
System IV – Coding of interconnecting wiring. This system should be employed to readily identify wiring
between complete units of electronic or electrical systems by means of marking on white insulated wires or
applying sleeves, tags, or pressure-sensitive tapes on the insulated wires.
System V – Direct wiring and open wiring. This system should be employed for direct, open chassis, and
cabinet wiring. The hookup wire (see 3.1) need not be color coded; solid white is the preferred color.
Permanently numbered sleeves can be used in conjunction with reference designations wherever practical; i.e.,
terminal boards, bus bars, capacitors, relays, etc.
System VI – Differential color coding of hookup wire for chassis and interconnection wiring. This system should
be employed for identification of wiring in high density wired chassis units and the interconnection between
them. Identification may be accomplished by use of solid color insulated wire, circumferential bands or spiral
stripes on white insulated wire, or printed sleeve or tape markers. Short hookup wire, six inches or less
between termination points, need not be marked if the path of the short wire can be easily and visually traced.

5. DETAIL REQUIREMENTS
5.1 System I – Differentiation color coding for wiring (see 1.2).
5.1.1 Standard color code for single wires. Single conductor chassis wires to be coded for differentiation only shall
be identified by colors in table I, preferably in the order given. All the combinations listed in table I are made up of the
first 10 colors.
5.1.1.1 Method of color coding. Color coding shall be accomplished by use of solid colored insulations, and by
helical striping or circumferential banding on all-white insulation, in accordance with 5.7 except that system VI shall
be used for circumferential banding (see 5.6). Longitudinal (nonhelical) color striping may be used if colored
insulation material is used for striping. Materials or paints used for helical striping or circumferential banding shall not
be electrically conductive.
5.1.1.2 Identification numbers. Identification numbers appearing in table I are a ready reference to color
combinations. The first digit indicates the background color (color of insulation or braid), and the succeeding digit or
digits, if any, indicate the colors of the helical stripes or circumferential bands. Therefore, the second and third digit
indicates the color of the first and second stripe or band, respectively.
5.1.1.3 Color sequence of helical stripes or circumferential bands. Where stripes or bands are used, the first stripe
or band shall be of the color with the lowest identification number, the second with the next higher number, and the
third with the highest number.
5.1.2 Harness wiring. Unless the wiring is routed to the same terminal, two or more wires shall not be identically
color coded if they break out of a harness and are routed in terminations in close proximity where they could be
misconnected.

MIL-STD-681E
5.1.3 Grouping of wires. Where it is not practical to use wires each of which is differently color coded, the wires may
be divided into groups. (Typical instances are where many wires enter a connector, or connect to grouped terminal
blocks, or multiple terminations in close proximity.) Within each group, each wire shall be differently color coded, and
the groups shall be distinguished by colored metal bands, pressure-sensitive tapes, or other approved devices that
hold each group of wires together. The wire color coding sequence may be repeated in different groups. This
method shall be used only where a large number of wires is involved.
5.1.4 Termination points. Wires terminating where it would be difficult to distinguish one wire from another shall not
be identically color coded unless the wiring is routed to the same termination point. For example, if three wires from
one harness, three wires from another harness, and two point-to-point wires are all connected to a tube socket,
different color coding shall be used on each wire to eliminate confusion.
5.2 System II – Functional color coding of chassis wiring. Simple electronic connections where it is advantageous to
identify circuit function (see 1.2).
5.2.1 Standard colors. Colors used to identify chassis wires by function shall be as specified in table II and 5.2.2
unless otherwise specified by the contracting activity. Color identification shall be accomplished by use of solid color
insulation, or as an alternate method, by use of a single colored helical stripe or circumferential band over white
insulation. For example, a white insulated wire having a blue helical stripe or a blue circumferential band would be
considered an alternate equivalent to a solid blue wire. When more than one value of the same function must be
identified, the alternative method may use a second stripe or band over white insulation as shown in table I.
5.2.2 Miscellaneous circuits. White insulation shall be used for all circuits not designated in tables II, III, and IV or
5.2.3.
5.2.3 Direct-coupled circuits. In direct-coupled circuits, connecting wires shall be white with appropriately colored
helical stripes or circumferential bands at the ends of the insulated wire to identify the elements to differentiate from
the method of marking described in 5.2.2. For example, if a plate is connected directly to a control grid, the wire shall
be white with helical green and blue stripes, or have green and blue circumferential bands at both ends of the wire
(green designates grid, and blue, the plate). This is in contrast to the coding of wires connecting plate and grid
through a coupling capacitor; in such case the wire from the plate to the capacitor would be solid blue, or have a blue
stripe or band on a white wire (for the plate), and the wire from the other end of the capacitor to the grid would be
black, or have a black stripe or band on a white wire (for the grid). This method of identification will normally be
applied by the equipment fabricator to white insulated wire, when required.
5.3 System III – Differentiation or functional coding of chassis wiring by printed markings. Chassis wiring shall be
identified by printed characters (see table V) over white insulation or white insulation-braid. The printed characters
shall represent differentiation or functional code marking (see 1.2).
5.3.1 Differentiation marking. Wires shall be differentiated by printing the name(s), abbreviation(s) in accordance
with ASME Y14.38, or identification number(s) of the colors and combinations listed in table I. Random printed
numbers for alpha numerical characters designating specific coded information may be used provided this specific
coding is not intermixed with stripe or band identification. The marking shall appear either along the entire length of
the wire at 2-inch intervals, at each end of the wire (for wire harnesses only), on sleeves, or in the manner prescribed
in applicable specifications.
5.3.2 Functional markings. Functional information shall be as specified in table II or in the applicable equipment
specification. Such information shall be printed either at the ends of the wire, on the sleeve, or in some other manner
as prescribed in the applicable equipment specification.
5.4 System IV – Coding of interconnecting wiring.
5.4.1 Wire insulation color. White insulation shall be used for all interconnecting wires unless a particular color is
prescribed in the equipment or system specification to identify a definite arrangement of elements, a specific function,
or a hazardous condition.
5.4.2 Differentiation markings. Circuit identification, if required, shall be printed in black on the wire insulation, on the
white sleeve, or on some other type of marker. Printed markings shall be legible and applied so that the wire type is
readily identified.

5.4.3 Interconnecting wiring on aircraft and guided missiles. The coding of interconnecting wiring on aircraft shall be
in accordance with MIL-W-5088, and on guided missiles shall be in accordance with MIL-W-5088. In the event of
conflict between the requirements of this standard and those of the referenced specifications, the requirements of the
referenced specifications shall govern.
5.4.4 Flat, multiconductor, homogenous cable. When color coding is required, the base colors of table I shall be
used, and shall be repeated in sequence for the required number of conductors by using solid colored insulation or
striping on all-white insulation.
5.5 System V – Direct wiring and open wiring.
5.5.1 Wire insulation color. White insulation shall be used for all interconnecting wires, unless a particular color is
prescribed in the equipment or system specification to identify a definite arrangement of elements, a specific function,
or a hazardous condition.
5.5.2 Differentiation markings. Identification, if required, shall be printed in black on the wire insulation, on the white
sleeve, or on some other type of marker. Printed markings shall be legible and applied so that the marking function is
readily identified.
5.6 System VI – Differential color coding for high density chassis and interconnecting wiring (see 1.2).
5.6.1 Method of color coding. Color coding shall be accomplished by use of solid color insulations, circumferential
banding on all-white insulation or numerically marked sleeve or tape markers. Materials or paints used for
circumferential banding or numeric marking shall not be electrically conductive.
5.6.2 Circumferential banding.
5.6.2.1 Identification numbers. Identification numbers shall consist of not more than four digits, which may be either
in sequential or ascending sequential order, deleting the digit 9 for white.
5.6.2.2 Color sequence of circumferential bands. The circumferential bands shall be parallel to each other, be
clearly defined and, within and between repeated color groupings, consistent in width and spacing for the length of
the wire, and essentially continuous except that discontinuities may be permitted provided the coded identity can be
read by rotating the wire.
a.
Band width. The width of the bands shall be measured perpendicular to the centerline of the band. The
width of all bands shall be not less than 0.031 inch when the diameter over the marked surface exceeds
0.047 inch; or not less than two-thirds the nominal diameter of the surface when the diameter over the
marked surface is 0.047 inch or less.
b.
Band spacing. The spacing between bands in a group shall be not less than the individual band width,
except that the spacing between the first band in a group of three or four shall be twice the spacing between
the bands in the remainder of the group.
c.
Spacing between groups of bands. The spacing separating a group of bands from the next grouping shall be
greater than the widest spacing between bands within a group, but not exceed 3 inches, and be repeated
along the length of the wire.
d.
Sequence of reading. The wire number represented by the color banding is read by starting with the band
further displaced from the remaining two or three bands.
5.6.3 Wire markers. Numerically marked sleeves, tapes or pressure sensitive tapes may be applied at the ends of
the insulated wire or braided covering where wire diameter, cable concentricity or insulation type preclude the
application of circumferential bands.

5.7 Striping or banding.
5.7.1 Colored helical stripes or circumferential bands. Colored helical stripes or circumferential bands shall be used
only on all-white insulation wherever color combinations other than solid colored wires are necessary. Not more than
three stripes or bands shall be used. Stripes and bands shall be applied in the same direction and shall conform to
the color code designated in table I. Longitudinal (nonhelical) color striping may be used if colored insulation is used
for striping.
5.7.2 Sequence. In the sequence of applying helical stripes or circumferential bands on a wire, the first stripe or
band shall be distinguishably wider than the second and third stripe or band within the group. Helical stripes shall run
parallel to each other and shall be continuous, clearly defined, and constant in width and spacing throughout the
length of the wire. Circumferential bands shall be parallel to each other around the circumference of the wire, shall
be clearly defined, shall be constant in width and spacing, and shall be continuous in repeated color groupings for the
length of the wire unless specified (see 5.2.3).
5.7.2.1 Stripe or band width. The width of the stripe or band shall be measured perpendicular to the centerline of the
stripe or band. The width of the wide (first) stripe or band shall be not less than 0.031 inch when the diameter over
the marked surface exceeds 0.047 inch; when the diameter over the surface on which the stripe or band shall be not
less than two-thirds the nominal diameter of the surface. The narrow (second and third) stripe or band shall be not
less than one-half nor more than three-quarters the width of the wide (first) stripe or band. The third stripe or band
shall be of the same width as the second stripe or band.

5.7.2.2 Stripe or band spacing. On single stripe or band coloring, the spacing between each stripe or band shall be
not less than twice the width of the individual stripe or band. On multiple stripe or band coloring, the spacing between
stripes or bands within a grouping shall be not less than the width of the narrow stripe or band.
5.7.2.3 Length of lay (spacing between groups). The spacing between groups of bands shall be at regular intervals
along the wire. The spacing separating a group of bands from the next grouping shall be greater than the spacing
between the bands within a group, but shall not exceed 3 inches.
NOTE: Length of lay is defined as the longitudinal distance along the wire from the starting point of
one grouping of stripes to the starting point of the next repetition of the grouping. Also, length of lay
required does not apply if stripes of colored insulation material are used.
5.7.2.4 Spacing between groups of bands. The spacing between groups of bands shall be at regular intervals along
the wire. The spacing separating a group of bands from the next grouping shall be greater than the spacing between
the bands within a group, but shall not exceed 3 inches.
5.8 Braided wire covering. When the wire covering includes a braided covering (of synthetic yarn or continuous
filament glass yarn) over the insulation, with systems I and II color coding, the braided covering shall be the same
base color; with systems III, IV, and VI color coding, the insulation and braided coverings shall be natural white. If
color coded striping or banding is required on braided covering of systems I, II or IV color coded wires, the method
described in 5.5 shall be adopted. If color coded banding is required on braided covering of system VI color coded
wires, the method described in 5.6 shall be adopted. When helical stripes are used, colored carriers of suitable
widths shall be used to form the coding stripes. The narrow (second and third) stripe, when applicable, shall be
formed by using colored yarn in one carrier. The spacing between stripes in any group shall be formed by one base
color carrier. The colored helical stripe, striping sequence, and length of lay shall be in accordance with 5.7.1, 5.7.2,
5.7.2.1, 5.7.2.2, and 5.7.2.3.
