The same measurement can be applied to components of the
positive power path as well.  Remember, we're measuringthe resistance of wire plus bolted and crimped joints.  Whenmeasuring the resistance of the lead between batterycontactor and the starter contactor, probe the bolt ends oneach contactor. Obviously, this same test fixture can be usedto check path resistance on any other circuit on the airplaneand produce results with great integrity. FBOs will oftenhave the instruments necessary to set up this fixture but notone in a hundred knows how to do it, how it is used or whatthe readings mean. The 4-wire ohmmeter is a standardinspection and diagnostic aid in my toolbox. Elsewhere inthis work,  I'll discuss techniques for using the 4-wireohmmeter tool to track down the elusive, "jittery ammeter"syndrome.GROUND LOOPS
A recurring problem experienced by our readers is thecomplaint that engine gages on  a composite, canard  pushershift reading in response to changing electrical loads or whenturning the alternator on and off.  Another common "noise"complaint is strong alternator whine in the headsets . . .sometimes when radios and intercom are OFF! Both of thesephenomenon are  commonly  driven by what are calledground loops.  Ground loops are pretty simple  and occur only when two
components of the same system (victim)  are grounded indifferent places in the airplane.  In Chapter 8, I discussed thefact that wire--no matter how big it is--can never have zeroresistance.  In preceding paragraphs of this chapter,  Idiscussed the 4-wire ohmmeter as a practical means forquantifying very low resistance values and their effects onstarter system performance.  Starters are not the onlypotential victims of voltage drops around what  one usually
considers to be a verylow resistance,ground conductorpath.
Consider that engine
instrumentationmeasures smallchanges in voltage ona variety of sensorsexposed tophenomenon ofinterest such astemperature,  pressure,etc.  Let us supposethat an engine-mounted, oil pressuretransducer has aresistance variation of100 to 500 ohms overthe range of 0 to 100psi on the panel-mounted indicator.Let us further supposethat the indicatorsystem biases thesensor with 10milliamperes ofcurrent.  The voltagechange across thesensor will be (500-100) x (0.01) = 4 voltsfor 0 to 100 psi or 25pounds per squareinch per volt.
