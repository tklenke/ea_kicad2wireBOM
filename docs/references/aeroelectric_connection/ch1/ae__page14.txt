DC and Wiring Fundamentals

connection between two main terminals.  Note that the
starter contactor symbol shows a built in diode . . . NOTALL contactors have this feature . . . but if the contactoryouâ€™ve selected includes the spike catcher diode, figure 1-14 suggests how to depict it.
 There is nothing unique about the symbol for a contactor
to differentiate a continuous duty contactor (for battery,crossfeed and ground power applications) from theintermittent duty devices (used on starters and some landinggear pump installations).  This differentiation is describedin your reference designator list or bill of materials.
Relays are more like switches in that they are available in
multiple poles.  If needed, you can easily acquire up to 4poles of double-throw relay in a compact, single device.Your project may not need any relays but they can be useful
in flap and trim motor control systems, over-voltage controlimplementation on small alternators and pilot-prioritymicrophone selection.
CONNECTORS and CONNECTIONS : As the various
wires wend their ways about your airplane, they have to startand stop somewhere and somehow. There are basically twoways to attach wires to things, crimp the  buggers with someform of solderless connection or warm up the soldering ironand stick them together.
Wires will terminate either in some device that mounts the
wire to a stud, a passageway through a de-mateableconnector, or solder to the terminal provided on some
device.
