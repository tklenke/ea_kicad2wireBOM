Figure 1-4 Current and Voltage in a Simple Landing Light CircuitSuppose you found a landing light bulb marked "150
Watts" on its face. It may or may not be marked for itsrated operating voltage but in 14-volt systems (12-voltbatteries) the design point for many large lamps is 13.0volts. Later on in this publication there will be a section onwiring where you will find a wire table that says a 16 gauge
wire has a resistance of .004 ohms per foot. Not much butsignificant. Let's suppose that your airplane is a compositestructure and that the landing light is out on a wing tip. Youneed to run two lengths of wire, a source and a return linefor the electron flow since there is no metal airframe toprovide the second path. Suppose that the total run of wirein the schematic is 24 feet times .004 ohms/foot yields atotal loop wiring resistance of .096 ohms.
To figure the voltage drop in the wiring, we must first
deduce the amount of current required by the lamp.Applying formula (4) above we can say the following:
150 Watts = Amps x 13.0 VoltsTransposing we can say:
             Amps = 150 Watts  รท 13.0 Volts
 and Amps = 11.54If the total resistance of the wire is 0.088 ohms then we can
apply formula (1) from Figure 1-1 asfollows:
Volts = 11.54 Amps x .096 Ohmsand Volts = 1.1This hypothetical is illustrated in
Figure 1-4. The schematics don'tshow an alternator charging thebattery but let's assume there is oneso that the voltage at the batteryterminals is 13.8 Volts. We havecalculated a drop in the wires of 1.1volts. Figure 1-4 shows  0.5 voltsdropped along the ground path, and0.6 volts dropped in the other (theswitch adds a tad more resistance tothe circuit). The lamp is beingsupplied with 13.8 - 1.1 = 12.7 volts.Not much below the rated 13.0 volts.
In working this example we have
uncovered techniques used bymanufacturers of electricalcomponents to make your selectionand application easier. Most heavycurrent devices are designed andrated for some voltage less than thenominal  system voltage. In thiscase, a 13.0 volt rated lamp might beused in a 13.8 volt system and a 26volt rated lamp would be used in a27.6 volt system. The parts are
