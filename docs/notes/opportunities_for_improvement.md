# Opportunities for Improvement (OFI)

This document tracks potential improvements to the ea_tools project that are not currently prioritized but may be valuable in the future.

## Wire Marking Standard

### Practical Implementation Tools

**Source:** Aeroelectric Connection Chapter 8, lines 1021-1024

**Description:** Bob Nuckolls recommends using Digi-Key rolls of narrow tape with digits 0-9 for marking wires. This is a practical, proven method used in experimental aircraft.

**Opportunity:**
- Research and document specific Digi-Key part numbers for wire marking tape
- Evaluate alternative wire marking products (heat-shrink sleeves, label makers, etc.)
- Create a recommended tooling list for wire marking implementation
- Consider cost/durability tradeoffs between different marking methods

**Priority:** Low - Current standard is complete without specific product recommendations

**Status:** Deferred
